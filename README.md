## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- I learned how to implement new font styles into my workflow using google fonts.
- Further improved my understanding of CSS Flexbox and how to center align items, and also discovered nesting of multiple flexboxes to further achieve the desired layout.
- Further improved my understanding of the _'@media'_ attribute to create device responsive designs.

### Continued development

- I would like to further build my proficiency in CSS flexbox to create resposive layouts at a quicker pace, as I spent alot time figuring out how to align my content and debug any issues that arose.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - An excellent resource to make quick referrals, and the demo code provided helps me to better understand the code I write.

- [CSS Tricks (FlexBox)](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - An extensive article that thoroughly explains flexbox and provides a very useful reference sheet.

## Questions

- Is the code I have written efficient? i.e Have I included redundant code or would there be a better/quicker/more efficient way to write a certain section of my code. ( Especially when it comes to my CSS).
- Have I implemented semantic HTML correctly / in the intended way?
